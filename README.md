# Deep learning Course Project - Cryptocurrency Price Prediction


>Cryptocurrency prices go up and down a lot, making it hard to predict when to invest. But here's the interesting part: we can use deep learning algorithms to forecast how cryptocurrency prices might behave. 
>We got our data from Kaggle.com, covering info on over 7,500 coins connected to the US dollar. It's a handy resource for studying digital currencies, including both new and popular ones like BTC, ETH, and SOL.
>The data includes details like Name, Symbol, Date, Open, High, Low, Close, and Adj Close, from 2014 to now (2023).
>Our plan is to use multiple LSTM layers in the model, building on a setup by lucasdataartist on Kaggle.com with a few tweaks.
>While their focus was on statistics, we're making it better by adding two more LSTM layers with 32 units each, throwing in another dense layer with 16 units, and adjusting the number of training rounds for more accurate predictions.
